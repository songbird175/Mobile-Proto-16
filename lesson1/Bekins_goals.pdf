# My Mobile Proto Learning Goals

## Celina Bekins

**What are your learning goals for the semester?**

By the end of this semester, I want to feel confident in my ability to develop an app. I also want to feel more confident in my ability to code in general - I'm still relatively new to programming, and every project that I really throw myself into helps me feel more capable. Throughout the semester, I want to make sure that I'm giving my all to this class. I'm taking only 16 credits and I'm extremely excited for this course, so I want to make sure I treat it like the priority it is.

**What are you most excited about?**

I'm most excited to see what cool project ideas we come up with as a class, and to work on my skills.

**What are you worried about?**

I'm worried that I might get behind quickly, but who knows?

**What would you like the teaching team to know about your previous experiences (informal or formal) with software or independent studying that would help us plan for the term?**

I'm still a newbie! I've done a lot of work in Python, and I have a little bit of web dev experience, but that's about it. I really enjoy software, though, and I'm pretty good at knowing what to Google in order to figure things out.
